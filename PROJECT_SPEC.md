## Required Sections (in order)

1. Project Title + one-line value statement  
2. Problem Context (what was broken, inefficient, or risky)

6. Production Readiness (CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, security posture)  
7. Compliance/Standards (regulatory or industry alignment, if applicable)  
8. Tech Stack (grouped by role: compute, data, infra, ML, frontend)  
9. Artifacts (repo, demo, slides/paper, screenshots)  
10. License + Contact

## Content Rules

- Use **Problem -> Solution -> Impact** in every major section.
- Every claim must include either a metric, method, or evidence link.
- Prefer concrete numbers (latency, throughput, error reduction, cost/time saved).
- Include a **Quick Summary** of 5-6 bullets max for busy reviewers.

## Quality Gates Before Publish

- No broken links.
- Metrics are dated and reproducible.
- Screenshots/media load on mobile and desktop.
- Security/compliance statements are accurate and explicitly scoped.
- README and portfolio page tell the same core story.
